- dns = domain name server
- The internet is just a interconnected series of hosts
- Every host has a unique numeric ip address
- I believe on windows you can do a "mslookup" on a website to find its internal info
- http = hyper text transfer protocol
    -part of making a request for a web page
- http operates on port 80
- smpt is on port 25 etc.

HTML 5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- tag based language (almost always balanced with closing tags)
- head tag is where you put css and javascript type stuff
- to create a heading, use an 'h' tag (h1-h6... they get progressively smaller)
- 'p' for paragraph
- 'ul' stands for unnumbered list (on the other hand, 'ol' stand for numbered list)
    - it then contains 'li' tags underneath it
- the 'a' tag is more of an attribute tag, used for referencing stuff
- 'div' and 'span' are both invisible tags
    - 'div' is a block element -- the stuff begins and ends on its own line
    - 'span' is the same, but is an endline element, so there are no line breaks

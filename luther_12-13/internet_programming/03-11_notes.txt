- Word Ladder
	- A four letter word only has 100 different possible words with one different letter
		- Can generate that list of 100 possible words, and then you just need to check whether it is in the word list
		- Has it already been used

- AJAX
	- lets your javascript program communicate with the server
	- Can get data without going through the full refresh process
	- Create a XMLHttpObject
		- a javascript object that we can use to make calls to another web server

	dat = new XMLHttpRequest()
	dat.open("GET", url, true) //GET or POST; 3rd parameter is the async
	dat.send(...)

	dat.onreadystatechange = function() {
		if (request.readyState == 3)
			if (request.status = 200) { //successful response
				
			}
	}

	Now do something with this data

--------------------
- content: html
- look and feel: css
- behavior: javascript

- html elements can be categorized two ways
    - block: creates blocks on the page (duh...)
        - ul, ol, table, pre, div, form, headers
    - inline
        - img, a, span

- Reserved Characters
    - > (&gt;), <,(&lt;)

- div's allow us to make layout for a page (ex: header, content, sidebar, footer), especially in conjuction with CSS
    - different div for each section

- Next homepage will be using 2 columns with header and a footer format using CSS (probably due on Fri)

- There are now audio, video and canvas tags with html5

---------------------
- Want to link to CSS stylesheets so that designers can make the page look pretty without having to mess with the content
- CSS
    - selectors at their simplest level are html tags
    - example properties: color, font style, alignment, width, height, etc.
    - another example selector: p a { } -- which means any "a" tag that is inside a "p" tag
    - divs
        - div { } matches every div
        - #d1 { } only matches the div where id = d1
    - Using class values
        - For the tags with <li class="low">, <li class="high">
            - You can then use a selector as li.low to change just the li items where class="low"
    - For font family, you can list multiple fonts and it will try them from left to right, until it finds one it can use
- How is CSS used?
    - Display
        - block, inline, none
            - none makes some elements disappear
            - If you wanted to make a list flow as "item 1 item 2 item 3" use display: inline;
    - Position
        - static
            - Elements Render in Order
        - relative 
            - left:20 would move the object 20 px's left from its normal left position 
        - absolute
            - positions relative to the containing object
            - useful for say a sidebar that you don't want to move when you scroll
        - Almost all positional values can be specified in terms of px or %
    - Float

For Friday Modify the homepage
- Header that spans the whole top of the page
- Two columns in the middle
- Footer on the bottom
